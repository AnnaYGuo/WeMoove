\section{Pose Estimation Models}
\label{sec:models}

The first step in developing this project was to define the parameters and requirements in order to choose models and algorithms that satisfy our expectations.
The first model that will be implemented on our project is a Pose Estimation Model. The requirements we defined were: limit GPU usage, multiple persons detection, 
and output in the form of JSON files, in order to be transferable and readible for the subsequent sections of our project.  We also set a high priority on accuracy,
due to the requirements for the other portions of our project\cite{Alpher08}. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Model Choices}
 
Options that we considered for use in this project include OpenPose, MediaPipe, and MoveNet. All of which will be detailed below.

The first model we tested was MediaPipe, which is a Framkework with many applications that has been widely used by Google for 
numerous products and services\cite{Authors14f}. Although, at first glance MediaPipe providedsatisfactory results, after further inspection and 
testing, the model did not satisfy our requirements. The first limitation is that MediaPipe only performs single-person analysis. Other limitations 
we encountered after testing were lower accuracy than expected, as well as difficulty converting the output into JSON filed.Thus, we continued 
our research for other models. 

Our second option was MoveNet, which is a pose estimation model developed by Google, which uses deep learning techniques. It is an improved version 
of the previous generation PoseNet model, released in 2017\cite{Authors14a}. Though this worked quickly, it did not have the desired accuracy for the video inputs.
Similar to MediaPipe, there was significant dificulty converting the output to JSON files. Although this proved more successful than MediaPipe, 
it still was not satisfying our requirements. 

Finally, we tested OpenPose, a software for pose estimation, which has proved to work well when evaluation multiple persons, even for more crowded scenes. 
It uses a bottom-up approach to produce higher quality results, through at a higher computation cost compared to MediaPipe and MoveNet\cite{Alpher07}. Additionally, it outputs JSON files, 
one per video frame, containing data for keypoints (e.g., left knee, right knee, etc.). Because of its high accuracy and usable output, OpenPose was selected for this proejct 
over MediaPipe and MoveNet.

\subsection{Challenges with OpenPose}

Since OpenPose was a rather new concept to our team, we initially had some trouble setting it up and running on our own devices. At first, it appeared to require more significant computational 
resources that were readily available. However, after extraneous research we were able to set it up and get it runnning properly. Due to our lack of experience with OpenPose, there was a learning 
curve in figuring out how exactly the model operates and what we could do with it, but over time, we were able to learn how to use it well.

As we became more familiar and comfortable with the OpenPose model, we were able to test the effects of different types of videos as inputs. We learned that lowering the resolution of a video and 
then inputting it to the program resulted in a significantly faster processing time. However, this also consistently resulted in decreased accuracy in the pose estimation. Thus, after several rounds 
of testing, we ultimately decided against reducing the resolution in our input videos since accuracy was crucial to this project.


% \subsection{Paper length}
% Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
% The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
% For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
% {\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

% Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.
% This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
% Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
% The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts.
% The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{The ruler}
% The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review.
% The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution.
% If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\ document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages.
% The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
% The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.
% (\LaTeX\ users may use options of \texttt{cvpr.sty} to switch between different versions.)

% Reviewers:
% note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.
% Just use fractional references (\eg, this line is $087.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


% \subsection{Paper ID}
% Make sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the ``*****'' you see in this document).
% If you are using the \LaTeX\ template, \textbf{make sure to update paper ID in the appropriate place in the tex file}.


% \subsection{Mathematics}

% Please number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:
% \begin{equation}
%   E = m\cdot c^2
%   \label{eq:important}
% \end{equation}
% and
% \begin{equation}
%   v = a\cdot t.
%   \label{eq:also-important}
% \end{equation}
% It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.
% Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it.
% It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''.
% (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers).
% All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
% \url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

% \subsection{Blind review}

% Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review.
% Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.

% Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work.
% That is all.
% (But see below for tech reports.)

% Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
% it says that you are building on her work.
% If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

% An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Removed for blind review
% \end{quote}


% An example of an acceptable paper:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%      An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of the  paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature 381(12), 1-213.
% \end{quote}

% If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
% In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
% \begin{quote}
% [1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
% \end{quote}

% Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
% For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
% Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
% Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
% Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

% Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
% For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the 1970 audience would like to hear about your
% solution.
% The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

% You can handle this paper like any other.
% Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
% This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
% That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
% Instead write the following:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
%    We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
%    This system is new because it handles the following cases:
%    A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
%    Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

%    ...

%    The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
%    It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
% \end{quotation}
% As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
% A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
% He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.

% FAQ\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
% {\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
% {\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
% For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
% Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

% Compare the following:\\
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
%  \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
% \end{tabular}\\
% See The \TeX book, p165.

% The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
% So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
% The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

% When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
% If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
% However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
% Thus, the following is correct:
%    ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
%    It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
%    Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

% This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.
